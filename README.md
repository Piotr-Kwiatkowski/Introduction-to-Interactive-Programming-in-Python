<h1>CodeskulptorSIMPLEGUI</h1>

Projects created for <b>Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</b> course at [Coursera.org](http://coursera.org/).
To run any of these programs you have to visit [CodeSkulptor.org](http://codeskulptor.org), paste the code delivered and click Run or simply use the link placed at the beginning of every file.

In the near future I'm planning to rework all of these using <b>SimpleGUICS2Pygame</b>, but please, be patient.

Feel free to leave any comments.
