<h1>CodeskulptorSIMPLEGUI</h1>

What you can find here are the projects created for <b>Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</b> course at [Coursera.org](http://coursera.org/).
For online testing purposes every project is put in one .py file.

To run any of these programs you have to visit [CodeSkulptor.org](http://codeskulptor.org), paste the code delivered and then click Run or... <i>simply use the link placed at the beginning of every file</i>.

In the near future I'm planning to re-work all of these using <b>SimpleGUICS2Pygame</b>, so there would be no need for visiting CodeSkulptor (and no more global-like nonsense!), but please, be patient.

Feel free to leave any comments.
